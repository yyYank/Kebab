# How to contribute

## Build Environment

Kebab builds with Gradle. You do not need to have Gradle installed to work with the Kebab build as Gradle provides an executable wrapper that you use to drive the build.

On UNIX type environments this is gradlew and is gradlew.bat on Windows.

For example to run the Geb test suite for the entire project you would run…

    ./gradlew test
